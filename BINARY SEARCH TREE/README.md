**Binary search tree** is a binary tree, where each node represents an objects in a set. The nodes are ordered in such a manner, that for each node, all the nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the node itself, and similarly on the right side, all the nodes in the subtree are of greater value. Because of this, we can easily find a ndoe from the tree by beginning our search from the root.

In this exercise, we practice with **Binary Search Tree** by filling the two classes in this repository.

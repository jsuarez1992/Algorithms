Linked list comprises of nodes, which each contain one element of the list. A linked list can be linked to one direction or both directions, i.e. singly linked list or a doubly linked list. In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next one, and in doubly linked list, a node has a reference to both the next and the previous one.

The goal of this exercise is to practice Linked List and add/remove nodes in said list, as seen in the class **LinkedList**.

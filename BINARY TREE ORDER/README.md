A binary tree is made out of n nodes. At the top of the tree is a node, which is called a root. Since we are looking at a binary tree (bi = duality, a pair), each node can have two children, left and right, and all the nodes (excluding the root) can have exactly one parent. The leafs of the tree are the nodes without any children.

In this exercise, I practice order in Binary Tree. The current code has a pre-order a and in-order b, so the code should give the post-order of the tree.Fill in the class **Order**.

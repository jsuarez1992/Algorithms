For an array, **inversion** indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0. If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum.
Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

In this exercise, the class **Inversions** with the int Create returns the array with **n integers and k inversions**.
